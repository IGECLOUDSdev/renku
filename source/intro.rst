.. epigraph::

   **Renga** (連歌), plural **renga**, a genre of Japanese linked-verse poetry in which two or more poets supply alternating sections of a poem linked by verbal and thematic associations.

   -- Encyclopædia Britannica


**RENGA** is a highly-scalable & secure open software platform designed to foster multidisciplinary data (science) collaboration across mutually untrusted academic and industrial institutions.
As in the traditional art form of renga from which it borrows its name, the platform encourages the interdisciplinary cooperation (or coopetition) between data scientists to advance a research thematic through individual research leap contributions.

The platform allow practitioners to:

* Securely manage, share and process large-scale data across untrusted parties operating in a federated environment.
* Capture complete lineage automatically up to original raw data for detailed traceability (auditability & reproducibility).
